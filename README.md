# Data Scraper for the AONPRD (2nd edition)

Currently: WIP!

## Goal:
Get data for creating markdown files for Obsidian.md

## How to Use:
1) Install PyCharm (or any other editor you want)
   - Currently using python 3.9
2) Run main.py file
    - `python main.py`
3) The json files are located in `out/`
   - `out/json` holds the restructured json files
     - may miss some variables, if so please report
   - `out/json_original` holds the data that was scraped from the 2e.AONPRD Rest-API
